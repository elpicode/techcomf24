## **Areas for Improvement**

### **A. Clarity of Instructions**

1. The step "Releasing the Door Panel," contain multiple actions within a single bullet point. They should be broken into smaller steps to enhance clarity.
2. The "clockwise or counterclockwise" phrasing may confuse users. Explicit directionality would help (e.g., "begin from the lower left corner and work clockwise").
3. Adding specific quantities for materials and estimated heating times for the hairdryer in instructions on fixing insulation and sealant issues would improve precision.


### **B. Formatting and Visual Elements**

1. Steps in section "Addressing Insulation and Sealant Issues" are presented as paragraphs rather than numbered or bulleted lists, which disrupts readability. Use consistent bulleting or numbering for all steps.
2. The absence of diagrams or photos makes the instructions harder to visualize. Include images or illustrations for key actions.
3. Try to upload the instruction via static website for easier future updates.


### **C. Accessibility**

1. Provide brief definition or link for term bitumen-based soundproofing to make the guide accessible.
2. Specifying approximate times per section would allow users to plan their work better.
