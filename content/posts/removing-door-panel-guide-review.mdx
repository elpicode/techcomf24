### **A. Clarity of Instructions**

1. The step "Releasing the Door Panel," contain multiple actions within a single bullet point. They should be broken into smaller steps to enhance clarity.

## **Detailed Feedback**

   The instructions are clear, but the absence of images makes them harder to follow. Including a diagram or visual aid showing where to begin prying would greatly improve clarity.

3. **Releasing the Door Panel**:  
   This section bundles multiple actions into a single point, which may confuse readers. Breaking the instructions into smaller, sequential steps would enhance readability and usability.

   The instructions provided are vague for beginners, especially regarding the use of tools and materials. Adding specific details about the tools required, material quantities, and heating times would make this section more actionable.

5. **Useful Tips**:  
   While the tips are valuable, their presentation could be improved. Formatting this section as a callout box or using bold headings would help draw attention to these important points.
